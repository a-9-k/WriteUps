# Compiled


Description:

    Download the task file and get started. The binary can also be found in the AttackBox inside the /root/Rooms/Compiled/ directory.

    Note: The binary will not execute if using the AttackBox. However, you can still solve the challenge.


The Task is giving a file to Download  Compiled-1688545393558.Compiled 


    file Compiled-1688545393558.Compiled
    Compiled-1688545393558.Compiled: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=06dcfaf13fb76a4b556852c5fbf9725ac21054fd, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not 

    it's an executable file 

I put the file on ghidra to decompile it, so i got the main function 

```sh

undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  char local_28 [32];
  
  fwrite("Password: ",1,10,stdout);
  __isoc99_scanf("DoYouEven%sCTF",local_28);
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"__dso_handle");
  if ((-1 < iVar1) && (iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"__dso_handle"), iVar1 < 1)) {
    printf("Try again!");
    return 0;
  }
  iVar1 = strcmp(local_28,"_init");
  if (iVar1 == 0) {
    printf("Correct!");
  }
  else {
    printf("Try again!");
  }
  return 0;
}



void _fini(void)

{
  return;
}
```
I put the function in chatgpt to make it easy for us to understand it :

```sh
It defines a function _init(EVP_PKEY_CTX *ctx) that calls __gmon_start__() 
and returns its result.

It defines a function FUN_00101020() that contains a call to an indirect 
function pointer at address 0x0.

It defines functions printf, strcmp, fwrite, __isoc99_scanf, __cxa_finalize,
processEntry, deregister_tm_clones,register_tm_clones, __do_global_dtors_aux
, frame_dummy, main, and _fini.

These functions handle standard input/output operations, string comparison, 
memory management, and program initialization and termination.

The main function prompts the user for a password, reads it using scanf, 
and compares it with two hardcoded strings ("__dso_handle" and "_init").

Depending on the comparison result, it prints "Try again!" or "Correct!".

```

In the C programming language, %s is a format specifier used with printf-family functions to indicate that a string (a sequence of characters) should be inserted at that position in the output. When printf encounters %s, it expects an argument of type char * (a pointer to a null-terminated string) that contains the string to be printed.

For example,
in the printf statement printf("DoYouEven%sCTF", local_28);, %s is used to specify the position where the string local_28 should be inserted into the output string. The actual value of local_28 will replace %s in the output.

in this case '_init' is the correct answer :

    ./Compiled-1688545393558.Compiled
    Password: DoYouEven_init
    Correct!
